# generate the interpolated airfoil
airfoil = af.Airfoil(x, y)
```

The airfoil is parametrised by `t âˆˆ [0, 1]`: `t = 0` and `t = 1` should be the trailing edge, while `t = 0.5` should be somewhere near the leading edge.
The value of `t` corresponding to a specific chord position can be calculated with `curvilinear_abscissa()`, giving a first approximation for `t` since there are usually multiple solutions:
```py
# suction side
t3s = airfoil.curvilinear_abscissa(0.3, 0.25)  # 0.34761588340824057

# pressure side
t3p = airfoil.curvilinear_abscissa(0.3, 0.75)  # 0.65480812484917
```

The coordinates for a given parameter `t` can be queried using `pos()`:
```py
# suction side
x3s, y3s = airfoil.pos(t3s)  # 0.3, 0.0771686

# pressure side
x3p, y3p = airfoil.pos(t3p)  # 0.3, -0.03793124
```

The normal vector can also be calculated:
```py
# suction side
nx3s, ny3s = airfoil.normal(t3s)  # -0.08282943442805163, 0.9965637384494426

# pressure side
nx3p, ny3p = airfoil.normal(t3p)  # -0.0349763290619618, -0.9993881410169672
```

Finally, given a point sufficiently close to the airfoil, the closest point on the airfoil can be found with `closest()`:
```py
t_closest, x_closest, y_closest = airfoil.closest(0.1, 0.04)  # 0.4479957791950058, 0.09823843, 0.04730137
```
